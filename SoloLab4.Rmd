Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
babies <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ervance1/Sp2018-Data-Science-repo/master/babies2a.dat")
babies <- rename(babies, bwtoz = `bwt/oz`)


ggplot(data=babies) +
  geom_jitter(mapping=aes(x=mage, y=gestation, color=parity)) +geom_hline(yintercept=270, color= 'red') + labs(title = "Mother's age vs Gestation period", x="Mother's age",y="Gestation Period" )
